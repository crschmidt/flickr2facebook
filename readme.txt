This tool is a quick hack that lets me copy photos from flickr to facebook.
It requires a 

name-map.txt should be a file formatted like:

tag: facebookuserid

Facebook User IDs got a bit harder to find when they switched to username
based links; if you search in the profile page for the text:

  profile_owner

There is text like:

data-gt="&#123;&quot;profile_owner&quot;:&quot;100003114317569&quot;,

the number you want is: 100003114317569
