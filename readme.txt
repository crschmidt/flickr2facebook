This tool is a quick hack that lets me copy photos from flickr to
facebook. I... don't know if this will work for anyone else. 

If you have a name-map.txt, a file formatted like:

tag: facebookuserid

Then it will map any photos you have tagged with that text to tag the
person.

Facebook User IDs got a bit harder to find when they switched to username
based links; if you search in the profile page for the text:

  profile_owner

There is text like:

data-gt="&#123;&quot;profile_owner&quot;:&quot;100003114317569&quot;,

the number you want is: 100003114317569
